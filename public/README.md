# Technify
[A tech job search app that focuses on local networking opportunities](https://ajgasca.github.io/ProjectOne/ "Technify Job Search")

## Overview
#### This app allows users to search for full and part-time jobs in different web development categories (front end, back end, and project design/user experience). _**NOTE:** The API used in this app requires the user to have the Chrome extension "Allow Control, Allow Origin" enabled._

#### When users submit their preferences, a list of matching jobs is populated, displaying the company name and  tagline, location, type of job, and job description, as well as a button to click for additional information.

#### When the additional info button is clicked, a modal is displayed with options to save the application URL to the database or to apply immediately. If the company has provided a specific location, the modal also displays a map of the city, and a hyperlinked list of local technology MeetUp groups in the city.

## Languages/Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap CSS
* Animate.CSS
* Plexels (for images)
* FontAwesome
* Bootstrap JS (for modals)
* jQuery
* Google Firebase
* Authentic Jobs API
* Google Maps API
* MeetUp API

## Challenges/Desired Improvements
#### The APIs proved particularly challenging - we wanted to use Indeed's job search API, but the application process for an API key was too rigorous and time-consuming. The Authentic Jobs API works fairly well, but is limited in scope - as such, we had to limit the amount of user input we could accept in order to populate results. _**Improvement:** We would use a better job search API that would allow for greater user input and filtering ability (location, salary, etc.)._

#### Both the Google Maps and MeetUp APIs had documentation that was difficult to navigate - we were able to do what we wanted to, but are sure there are greater possibilities with each.

#### Due to time constraints, we were unable to write the code for pulling saved application URLs from Firebase. _**Improvement:** We have a dummy link at the top of the page for "My Jobs" - ideally users would be able to click that link and be shown a list of their saved job links._

## **GitHub!** 
#### It was a definite challenge understanding the nuances of Git pushes and pulls from the different branches - we were often hesitant to try to commit to the remote repository out of fear of messing something up. 

### Overall, we are proud of the app and the way it turned out - there is plenty of room for improvements, but we believe it has potential going forward as a valuable tool for those looking to begin a career in the web development arena.
